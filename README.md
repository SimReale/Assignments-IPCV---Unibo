This is the work done for the **Image Processing ad Computer Vision** exam at the University of Bologna:

- `assignment1` is about object detection using the OpenCV library, with both single and multiple instance detection;
- `assignment2` is about training a Neural Network for image classification, with a first part where a VGG-inspired NN has been designed for the specific task and dataset and a second part that refers to the usage of ResNet-18 with fine-tuning tecniques.

Enjoy!
